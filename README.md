## 📌 Overview  

This project started as a side project — a way for me to learn how to integrate an SQLite database into a small application. At the same time, working daily with ANSYS, I found the built-in ANSYS License Manager confusing and cluttered with too much unnecessary data.  

So, I thought — why not combine both? 

The result? A cleaner, more intuitive ANSYS License Monitor that:  

✅ **Filters out unnecessary information**, showing only what’s relevant  
✅ **Clearly visualizes** which licenses are **in use**, **fully occupied**, or **available**  
✅ **Makes it easier for teams** to track license usage and avoid unnecessary delays  

It’s a small but useful tool that helps teams work more efficiently with ANSYS licenses - especially when licenses are limited within the team!
